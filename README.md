Hello fellow humans!

Mxx here and very new to coding. Going for Front-end so started with a bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Learning with Codecademy mainly and a bit of FreeCodeCamp and W3.schools.
Located in Wellington at the moment, but returning to Berlin soon if corona allows it.
I love theatre, reading, humans, social and environmental change and empowerment of marginalized voices. Ugh, that got heavy real quick.
But that's how I roll.
